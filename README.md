osm2gtfs
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grote/osm2gtfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grote/osm2gtfs)

Use public transport data from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
and external schedule information
to create a General Transit Feed ([GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)).

The official source code repository is at [github.com/grote/osm2gtfs](https://github.com/grote/osm2gtfs).

How does it work?
-----------------

The script retrieves current data about public transport networks directly from
OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. It stores the data in python objects and
caches on disk for efficient re-use. Then the data is combined with another
source of schedule (time) information in order to create a GTFS file using the
transitfeed library.

For every new city a new [configuration file](https://github.com/grote/osm2gtfs/wiki/Configuration)
needs to be created. Additionally, schedule information should be provided. By-default the schedule information is expected to be provided in a  [certain format](https://github.com/grote/osm2gtfs/wiki/Schedule). However other formats are supported through extending the code. For any city and schedule format the script can be easily extended, see the
[developer documentation](https://github.com/grote/osm2gtfs/wiki/Development)
for more information.
