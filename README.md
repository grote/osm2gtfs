osm2gtfs
========

Use public transport data from OpenStreetMap and external schedule information
to create a General Transit Feed (GTFS).

How does it work?
-----------------

The script retrieves current data about public transport networks directly from
OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. It stores the data in python objects and
caches on disk for efficient re-use. Then the data is combined with another
source of schedule (time) information in order to create a GTFS file using the
transitfeed library.

**Attention:** The source code is currently very specific to Florian√≥polis Buses
and Costa Rica Urban Train, but it can be extended to make it work for your use
case. In the config file any transit network can be specified for download from
OpenStreetMap. And by extending the creator classes in code, different
approaches for time information handling can be easily implemented. You can help
with pull requests to improve this script.
